name: lode-audit
description: >
  Audits lode/ documentation for content accuracy — checks whether each doc correctly
  describes the current codebase. Distinct from lode-sync (which only checks timestamps).
  Produces a staleness table with git-verified findings, then makes targeted updates only
  on the sections you approve. Use after large refactors, renames, or when the lode feels
  out of sync with the code.
  Triggers on: audit lode, lode out of date, update lode, lode accuracy check,
  is the lode correct, lode stale, lode content review, audit documentation,
  check lode, lode drift, lode wrong.
  Not for: updating a single known lode file (just edit it directly), or checking timestamps
  only (use lode-sync agent).
allowed-tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, Edit, Write, Agent

Audit lode/ documentation for content accuracy against the current codebase.

## Phase 0: Resume Check

```bash
cat .claude/tmp/lode-audit/state.md 2>/dev/null
```

If `state.md` exists, load it and skip phases already marked DONE. Otherwise:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/tmp/lode-audit
```

Initialize `state.md`:
```
# Lode Audit State
Started: {nu scripts/ts.nu}
```

---

## Phase 1: Enumerate Lode Files

Read `lode/lode-map.md` to extract all referenced `.md` file paths. For each path, extract the `*Updated:*` timestamp (format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`) and record the file path, timestamp (or "no timestamp"), and line count.

Save to `.claude/tmp/lode-audit/files.md`:
```
# Lode Files
| File | Updated | Lines |
|------|---------|-------|
| lode/summary.md | 2026-04-03T00:00:00Z | 42 |
...
```

Write to state.md: `- Phase 1 (Enumerate): DONE — {N} files found → files.md`

---

## Phase 2: Staleness Assessment

Use `nu scripts/lode-ts.nu --stale --json` to get a structured staleness report for all lode files in one call. This returns each file's `days_ago` and `commits_since` (commits to src/tests/scripts/.claude/skills since the file's timestamp).

Classification:
- `commits_since > 0` → **POTENTIALLY STALE**
- No timestamp in file → **NO TIMESTAMP** (not included in --stale output; check Phase 1 files.md for these)
- `commits_since == 0` → **CURRENT**

Skip `lode/tmp/` entries (session scraps).

Save to `.claude/tmp/lode-audit/assessment.md`:
```
# Staleness Assessment
| File | Updated | Commits Since | Status |
|------|---------|---------------|--------|
| lode/framework/rules.md | 2026-04-01 | 5 | POTENTIALLY STALE |
...
```

Write to state.md: `- Phase 2 (Assess): DONE — {N} stale, {M} current, {K} no-timestamp → assessment.md`

---

## Phase 3: Present Findings and Get Approval

Display the assessment table, sorted by: POTENTIALLY STALE first (descending commit count),
then NO TIMESTAMP, then CURRENT.

**Output format:**

```
Lode Audit Results

  # | File                              | Updated    | Commits | Status
----+---------------------------------+------------+---------+------------------
  1 | lode/framework/rules.md          | 2026-04-01 |       5 | POTENTIALLY STALE
  2 | lode/framework/skills.md         | 2026-03-28 |       3 | POTENTIALLY STALE
  ...
 12 | lode/summary.md                  | (none)     |       — | NO TIMESTAMP
 15 | lode/practices.md                | 2026-04-03 |       0 | CURRENT
```

Ask: **"Which entries do you want to update? Enter numbers (e.g. 1,3,5), 'all stale', or 'none'."**

Wait for response. Save approved list to `.claude/tmp/lode-audit/approved.md`.

Write to state.md: `- Phase 3 (Triage): DONE — user approved {N} files → approved.md`

---

## Phase 4: Targeted Updates

For each approved file, spawn a targeted agent:

```
Agent: general-purpose, max_turns: 12
Prompt:
  Audit and update the lode file: {file_path}

  Read it, verify its factual claims (class names, method signatures, file paths,
  configuration values, counts, architectural relationships) against current code
  using targeted Grep/Glob/Read — do NOT explore unrelated areas. Report what is
  CORRECT / STALE / MISSING, then apply the minimal edits to make it accurate.
  Preserve existing structure and prose style.
  Update the timestamp: `nu scripts/lode-ts.nu {file_path}`
```

After each agent completes, record in state.md:
`- Phase 4 ({file_path}): DONE — {summary of changes}`

Report progress as each file completes. After all approved files are done:

---

## Phase 5: Cleanup and Summary

1. Report a final summary table: files updated, key corrections made.
2. Delete checkpoint files:
```bash
rm -rf .claude/tmp/lode-audit/
```
3. Remind: stage the updated lode files before next commit.

---

## Rules

- **Skip lode/tmp/** — these are session scraps, not live descriptions of code.
- **Targeted verification only** — each agent reads the relevant code for its file only.
- **Preserve prose style** — corrections should read like the rest of the file.
- **Never auto-approve** — Phase 3 always waits for user input before modifying any file.
- **Commit count is a signal, not a verdict** — POTENTIALLY STALE means "check this", not "definitely wrong".
