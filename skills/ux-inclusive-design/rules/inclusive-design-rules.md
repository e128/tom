## Workflow Phase Sequencing Rules

The inclusive design evaluation follows a 7-step sequential workflow. Steps MUST execute in order -- no step may be skipped or reordered. Each step produces intermediate findings that feed subsequent steps.

> **Source:** Dual-framework evaluation workflow defined in `skills/ux-inclusive-design/agents/ux-inclusive-evaluator.md` `<methodology>` section. WCAG 2.2 POUR evaluation sequence from W3C (2023). Microsoft Inclusive Design methodology from Microsoft (2016).

### Phase Order Constraint

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| EV-001 | Steps MUST execute in the sequence: Step 1 (Context Gathering) then Step 2 (WCAG 2.2 POUR Audit) then Step 3 (Color Contrast) then Step 4 (Keyboard Navigation) then Step 5 (Screen Reader + Cognitive Load) then Step 6 (Persona Spectrum) then Step 7 (Synthesis + Report) | Evaluating Persona Spectrum (Step 6) without WCAG findings (Steps 2-5) produces exclusion analysis disconnected from compliance evidence; synthesizing without complete findings produces incomplete reports |
| EV-002 | Each step MUST complete before the next step begins -- partial step outputs MUST NOT be carried forward as complete | Downstream steps operating on incomplete upstream findings propagate gaps; conformance determination becomes unreliable |
| EV-003 | Step 1 (Context Gathering) MUST determine Figma MCP availability and activate degraded mode (screenshot-input) before Step 2 begins | Late mode detection requires re-evaluation of color contrast findings (Step 3) and component hierarchy assessments |
| EV-004 | Step 2 (WCAG 2.2 POUR Audit) MUST evaluate all four principles (P, O, U, R) sequentially -- principles MUST NOT be skipped unless the entire principle is not applicable to the input artifacts | Skipping a principle without N/A justification creates gaps in conformance determination |
| EV-005 | Steps 3, 4, and 5 MUST reference findings from Step 2 to avoid duplication -- if a success criterion was already evaluated in Step 2 with sufficient evidence, the specialized protocol in Steps 3-5 adds detail, not duplicates | Duplication inflates finding counts and creates inconsistent severity assignments for the same criterion |

### Step Summary

| Step | Name | Input | Output | Rules Governing Content |

## WCAG 2.2 POUR Evaluation Rules

WCAG 2.2 organizes accessibility requirements into four principles (POUR), each containing guidelines with testable success criteria at three conformance levels (A, AA, AAA).

> **Source:** W3C (2023). Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2. W3C Recommendation, 05 October 2023.

### Principle Evaluation Order

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| PR-001 | Principles MUST be evaluated in POUR order: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust | Consistent ordering enables cross-engagement comparison and ensures no principle is inadvertently skipped |
| PR-002 | Within each principle, guidelines MUST be evaluated in numerical order (e.g., 1.1 before 1.2 before 1.3 before 1.4 for Perceivable) | Numerical ordering ensures systematic coverage and enables reviewers to verify completeness |
| PR-003 | Within each guideline, success criteria MUST be evaluated up to and including the target conformance level | Evaluating Level A criteria is mandatory for all targets; Level AA criteria are additionally required for AA and AAA targets; Level AAA criteria are additionally required only for AAA targets |

### Principle Scope Rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| PS-001 | All four POUR principles MUST be evaluated -- no principle may be omitted without explicit N/A justification | Omitting a principle creates gaps in conformance determination; the achieved level cannot be determined without coverage of all principles |
| PS-002 | A principle is marked N/A only when the input artifacts contain no content addressable by that principle (e.g., Robust is N/A when no markup or code is available for evaluation) | False N/A marks suppress genuine findings; N/A must reflect genuine inapplicability, not evaluation difficulty |
| PS-003 | When a principle is marked N/A, the output MUST include a justification explaining why no content is addressable by that principle | Unjustified N/A marks cannot be distinguished from skipped evaluations |

### Conformance Level Scope Rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| CL-001 | When the target is A, evaluate all Level A success criteria | Level A is the minimum accessibility floor |
| CL-002 | When the target is AA, evaluate all Level A AND Level AA success criteria | AA conformance requires meeting all A and AA criteria (W3C, 2023) |
| CL-003 | When the target is AAA, evaluate all Level A, Level AA, AND Level AAA success criteria | AAA conformance requires meeting all criteria at all levels |
| CL-004 | The evaluator MAY note AAA-level findings even when the target is A or AA, but MUST mark them as beyond-scope recommendations, not conformance failures | AAA findings provide improvement opportunities but should not inflate the failure count for a lower target |

### POUR Principle Reference

| Principle | Letter | Key Guidelines | Success Criteria Count (WCAG 2.2) |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| Perceivable | P | 1.1 Text Alternatives, 1.2 Time-Based Media, 1.3 Adaptable, 1.4 Distinguishable | A: 9, AA: 7, AAA: 6 |
| Operable | O | 2.1 Keyboard, 2.2 Enough Time, 2.3 Seizures, 2.4 Navigable, 2.5 Input Modalities | A: 9, AA: 8, AAA: 7 |
| Understandable | U | 3.1 Readable, 3.2 Predictable, 3.3 Input Assistance | A: 5, AA: 4, AAA: 6 |
| Robust | R | 4.1 Compatible | A: 1, AA: 1, AAA: 0 |

**Note:** WCAG 2.2 removed SC 4.1.1 (Parsing) from Level A. The criterion count reflects the current WCAG 2.2 specification. SC 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value) and 4.1.3 (Status Messages) are Level A and AA respectively.

---

## Success Criteria Evaluation Format Rules

Every WCAG 2.2 success criterion evaluated MUST follow the canonical per-criterion format.

> **Source:** Agent definition `<methodology>` Step 2 [Per-criterion evaluation format]. Nielsen (1994b) severity scale.

### Required Fields

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| SC-001 | Every criterion evaluation MUST include all five fields: Status, Evidence, Affected Elements, Severity, Remediation | Incomplete criterion evaluations cannot be used for conformance determination or remediation planning |
| SC-002 | Status MUST be one of exactly three values: PASS, FAIL, or NOT APPLICABLE | Non-standard status values (e.g., "PARTIAL", "NEEDS REVIEW") create ambiguity; use FAIL with appropriate severity for partial failures |
| SC-003 | Evidence MUST describe specific observations, measurements, or test results -- not restatements of the success criterion itself | "No alt text found on hero image" is evidence; "Non-text content lacks text alternatives" is a criterion restatement, not evidence |
| SC-004 | Affected Elements MUST reference specific UI elements by selector, component name, or screen location | "Multiple elements" is insufficient; "Hero image in the product listing card" or "All form inputs in the checkout step 2 form" is specific |
| SC-005 | Severity MUST use the 0-4 scale defined in [Severity Scale](#severity-scale) | Non-standard severity values prevent cross-framework synthesis with `/ux-heuristic-eval` |
| SC-006 | Remediation MUST reference a specific WCAG technique (e.g., "Apply ARIA-label per Technique ARIA14") when a technique exists | Remediation without technique references is not actionable for engineering teams |

### Severity-Decision Rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| SD-001 | PASS criteria MUST always receive severity 0 | Assigning severity > 0 to a PASS finding creates contradictory status/severity pairs |
| SD-002 | Severity 1-4 MUST only be applied to FAIL findings | Severity on non-FAIL findings inflates barrier counts |
| SD-003 | NOT APPLICABLE criteria do not receive a severity rating -- omit the severity field or mark "N/A" | N/A criteria have no user impact to rate |
| SD-004 | Severity assignment for FAIL findings is an AI judgment classified as MEDIUM synthesis confidence | Presenting AI-assigned severity as objective measurement violates P-022 |

### Per-Criterion Output Format

```
### SC {X.Y.Z}: {Success Criterion Name} [{Level}]

- **Status:** PASS | FAIL | NOT APPLICABLE
- **Evidence:** {specific observation, measurement, or test result}
- **Affected Elements:** {UI element references, selectors, or screen locations}
- **Severity:** 0 (not a problem) | 1 (cosmetic) | 2 (minor barrier) | 3 (major barrier) | 4 (critical -- blocks access)
- **Remediation:** {specific fix with WCAG technique reference, e.g., "Apply ARIA-label per Technique ARIA14"}
```

---

## Severity Scale

The severity scale aligns with Nielsen's severity rating scale (Nielsen, 1994b) to enable cross-framework synthesis with `/ux-heuristic-eval` findings.

> **Source:** Nielsen, J. (1994b). Severity ratings for usability problems. In *Usability Inspection Methods*, pp. 413-414. John Wiley & Sons. Scale adapted for accessibility context per `skills/ux-inclusive-design/SKILL.md` [Success Criteria Evaluation Format].

| Severity | Label | Accessibility Interpretation | Nielsen Alignment | Action |
|----------|-------|------------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 0 | Not a problem | The criterion passes; no accessibility barrier exists | Not a usability problem | No action needed |
| 1 | Cosmetic | Minor accessibility issue that does not impede task completion; fix if time permits | Cosmetic problem only | Low priority; address in future sprints |
| 2 | Minor barrier | Accessibility barrier that causes some difficulty but users can work around it | Minor usability problem | Fix with low priority; users can complete tasks with extra effort |
| 3 | Major barrier | Significant accessibility barrier that causes serious difficulty for affected users | Major usability problem | Important to fix; high priority; significantly impedes affected users |
| 4 | Critical -- blocks access | Accessibility barrier that completely prevents task completion for affected users | Usability catastrophe | Must fix before release; prevents task completion entirely |

### Cross-Framework Severity Correspondence

| Severity | Inclusive Design Interpretation | Heuristic Eval Interpretation | Synthesis Signal |
|----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| 0 | WCAG criterion passes | Nielsen heuristic not violated | No convergence signal |
| 1 | Cosmetic accessibility issue | Cosmetic usability issue | Weak convergence -- low priority |
| 2 | Minor accessibility barrier | Minor usability problem | Moderate convergence -- validate with users |
| 3 | Major accessibility barrier | Major usability problem | Strong convergence -- high priority remediation |
| 4 | Access blocked entirely | Usability catastrophe | Critical convergence -- must fix |

**Handoff threshold:** Only findings with severity >= 2 are included in cross-framework synthesis handoffs. Severity 0 and 1 findings remain in the full audit report but are excluded from synthesis signal extraction.

## Microsoft Inclusive Design Rules

Microsoft Inclusive Design methodology (Microsoft, 2016) complements WCAG compliance with a design-thinking approach.

> **Source:** Microsoft (2016). Microsoft Inclusive Design Toolkit. microsoft.com/design/inclusive.

### Three Principles Application Rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| ID-001 | **Recognize Exclusion:** For each interaction pattern, the evaluator MUST identify specific design decisions that create barriers for users with permanent, temporary, or situational impairments | Failing to identify exclusion points produces Persona Spectrum profiles without actionable design direction |
| ID-002 | **Solve for One, Extend to Many:** Each Persona Spectrum profile MUST identify how solving for the permanent disability scenario extends benefits to temporary and situational users | Omitting the extension analysis misses the core value proposition of inclusive design -- solutions that benefit the broadest range of users |
| ID-003 | **Learn from Diversity:** When accessible, the evaluator SHOULD note adaptation strategies developed by people with disabilities that inform design improvements | Adaptation strategies provide design insights that complement WCAG technique references |

### Persona Spectrum Application Rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| PS-010 | A Persona Spectrum profile MUST be produced for each interaction pattern identified in the evaluated interface | Missing interaction patterns create gaps in exclusion analysis |
| PS-011 | Each Persona Spectrum profile MUST use the 4x3 matrix format: 4 disability types (Visual, Motor, Auditory, Cognitive) x 3 duration categories (Permanent, Temporary, Situational) | Non-standard matrix dimensions prevent cross-engagement comparison |
| PS-012 | Every cell in the 4x3 matrix MUST be populated -- when a scenario is not applicable, explicitly state "Low exclusion risk for this combination" rather than leaving the cell empty | Empty cells create ambiguity between "not evaluated" and "not applicable"; complete population ensures systematic coverage |
| PS-013 | Each Persona Spectrum profile MUST include three summary fields: Exclusion Points, Design Opportunity, and Current Compliance (WCAG success criteria cross-reference) | Summary fields connect the Persona Spectrum analysis back to actionable WCAG findings |
| PS-014 | Persona Spectrum profiles are classified as MEDIUM synthesis confidence -- they are heuristic models (Microsoft, 2016), not empirically grounded user research | Presenting AI-generated persona scenarios as validated user profiles violates P-022 |

---

## Persona Spectrum Methodology Rules

### Interaction Pattern Identification

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| IP-001 | The evaluator MUST identify interaction patterns from the input artifacts during Step 1 (Context Gathering) | Late identification of interaction patterns delays Persona Spectrum analysis and may result in incomplete coverage |
| IP-002 | Each interaction pattern describes a discrete user task or action (e.g., "complete checkout form", "navigate product catalog", "read notification") | Overly broad patterns (e.g., "use the application") produce generic Persona Spectrum profiles with low analytical value |
| IP-003 | The evaluator SHOULD identify at minimum 2 interaction patterns per evaluated interface or flow. For complex flows with many potential interaction patterns, prioritize patterns where WCAG FAIL findings with severity >= 2 were identified in Steps 2-5 | Single-pattern analysis may miss interaction-specific barriers; complex flows typically contain multiple distinct interaction patterns. Scope guidance prevents unbounded pattern proliferation on complex products |

### 4x3 Matrix Format

Each interaction pattern produces one Persona Spectrum profile using the following matrix:

| Disability Type | Permanent | Temporary | Situational |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Visual** | {scenario: e.g., blind user} | {scenario: e.g., post-surgery} | {scenario: e.g., bright sunlight} |
| **Motor** | {scenario: e.g., single arm} | {scenario: e.g., arm in cast} | {scenario: e.g., holding child} |
| **Auditory** | {scenario: e.g., deaf user} | {scenario: e.g., ear infection} | {scenario: e.g., loud environment} |
| **Cognitive** | {scenario: e.g., learning disability} | {scenario: e.g., concussion} | {scenario: e.g., distracted by children} |

### Matrix Population Rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| MX-001 | Each cell MUST contain a plausible user scenario specific to the interaction pattern -- not a generic disability description | "Blind user" without context of the specific interaction (e.g., "Blind user navigating product filter controls") produces non-actionable analysis |
| MX-002 | Scenarios MUST progress across the Permanent-Temporary-Situational spectrum in decreasing severity of impairment for the same disability type | Scenarios that do not follow the P-T-S progression obscure the "solve for one, extend to many" design insight |
| MX-003 | When a disability type and interaction pattern combination genuinely has low exclusion risk, state "Low exclusion risk for this combination: {brief reason}" | Unjustified low-risk claims mask evaluation gaps |

---

## Color Contrast Assessment Rules

Color contrast ratios are evaluated against WCAG 2.2 success criteria for distinguishable content.

> **Source:** W3C (2023). WCAG 2.2 Success Criteria 1.4.3 (Contrast Minimum, AA), 1.4.6 (Contrast Enhanced, AAA), 1.4.11 (Non-text Contrast, AA), 2.4.11 (Focus Appearance, AA, new in 2.2).

### Contrast Threshold Table

| Test | Element Type | Threshold (AA) | Threshold (AAA) | WCAG Criterion |
|------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Normal text contrast | Text < 18pt and not bold | >= 4.5:1 | >= 7:1 | 1.4.3 / 1.4.6 |
| Large text contrast | Text >= 18pt OR text >= 14pt bold | >= 3:1 | >= 4.5:1 | 1.4.3 / 1.4.6 |
| UI component contrast | Non-text UI components and graphical objects | >= 3:1 | >= 3:1 | 1.4.11 |
| Focus indicator contrast | Focus visible indicator against adjacent colors | >= 3:1 | >= 3:1 | 2.4.11 (new in 2.2) |

### Contrast Evaluation Rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| CC-001 | Every contrast evaluation MUST include foreground color, background color, computed ratio, target threshold, and pass/fail status | Incomplete contrast data prevents verification of the pass/fail determination |
| CC-002 | Color values MUST be specified as hex (#RRGGBB) or RGB (rgb(R, G, B)) format | Non-standard color formats prevent ratio computation verification |
| CC-003 | NEVER claim PASS for a contrast check without a computed ratio from hex/RGB values | Visual estimation from screenshots is not precise enough for compliance determination; unverified PASS claims create false legal compliance confidence |
| CC-004 | In degraded mode (screenshot-input), elements with potentially insufficient contrast MUST be flagged for manual measurement with the note: "Manual verification required -- hex/RGB values not available from screenshot" | Omitting the degraded mode flag conceals measurement limitations |
| CC-005 | Large text determination (>= 18pt or >= 14pt bold) MUST be documented per element -- do not assume text size without evidence | Incorrect large/normal text classification applies the wrong threshold, potentially producing false PASS results |

### Per-Element Output Format

| Element | Foreground | Background | Ratio | Target | Status |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| {element reference} | {hex/RGB} | {hex/RGB} | {computed ratio}:1 | {threshold for target level} | PASS / FAIL |

---

## Keyboard Navigation Test Protocol

Keyboard navigation is evaluated against WCAG 2.2 Operable principle success criteria.

> **Source:** W3C (2023). WCAG 2.2 Guideline 2.1 (Keyboard Accessible), Guideline 2.4 (Navigable).

### Test Matrix

| Test | Evaluation Criteria | WCAG Criterion | Level |
|------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| Tab order completeness | All interactive elements reachable via Tab/Shift+Tab | 2.1.1 | A |
| Focus visibility | Focus indicator visible on all focused elements | 2.4.7 (AA), 2.4.11 (AA, new in 2.2) | AA |
| No keyboard traps | Focus can be moved away from all components via standard keyboard keys | 2.1.2 | A |
| Shortcut conflicts | Single character key shortcuts can be turned off or remapped | 2.1.4 (A, added in WCAG 2.1; retained in 2.2) | A |
| Skip navigation | Skip-to-content mechanism available | 2.4.1 | A |
| Focus not obscured | Focused element not fully hidden by other content (e.g., sticky headers, modals) | 2.4.12 (AA, new in 2.2) | AA |

### Keyboard Test Rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| KB-001 | Every keyboard navigation issue MUST document: affected element, expected behavior, observed behavior, and WCAG criterion violated | Incomplete keyboard findings cannot be reproduced or remediated by engineering teams |
| KB-002 | Tab order evaluation MUST assess logical reading order, not just reachability -- elements reachable in an illogical order are a finding (severity 2-3) | Tab order that reaches all elements but in a confusing order creates cognitive barriers |
| KB-003 | Focus visibility MUST be evaluated for both default browser focus indicators and custom focus styles | Custom focus styles may be less visible than browser defaults; both must meet the 3:1 contrast requirement (2.4.11) |
| KB-004 | Keyboard trap detection MUST test both Tab and Escape key as exit mechanisms for modal dialogs, dropdown menus, and overlay components | Components that trap focus on Tab but release on Escape (or vice versa) are partial traps that still violate 2.1.2 |
| KB-005 | In degraded mode (screenshot-input), keyboard navigation findings are limited to structural assessment from visual layout -- flag as "Structural assessment only; manual keyboard testing required" | Screenshot analysis cannot verify actual keyboard behavior; limitations must be disclosed |

---

## Screen Reader Compatibility Test Protocol

Screen reader compatibility is evaluated through structural assessment of semantic HTML and ARIA implementation.

> **Source:** W3C (2023). WCAG 2.2 Principles 1 (Perceivable) and 4 (Robust). W3C (2023b). ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) 1.2.

### Test Matrix

| Test | Evaluation Criteria | WCAG Criterion | Level |
|------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| Heading hierarchy | Logical heading structure (h1-h6) without skipped levels | 1.3.1 | A |
| ARIA landmarks | Main, navigation, banner, contentinfo landmarks present and correct | 1.3.1, 4.1.2 | A |
| Alternative text | All non-decorative images have descriptive alt text; decorative images use empty alt | 1.1.1 | A |
| Form labels | All form controls have programmatically associated labels | 1.3.1, 3.3.2 | A |
| Live regions | Dynamic content updates announced via ARIA live regions | 4.1.3 | AA |
| Error identification | Error messages programmatically associated with the invalid field | 3.3.1 | A |

### Screen Reader Test Rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| SR-001 | Heading hierarchy assessment MUST identify skipped levels (e.g., h1 to h3 without h2) and missing top-level headings | Skipped heading levels break screen reader navigation and violate 1.3.1 |
| SR-002 | ARIA landmark evaluation MUST verify both presence and correct usage -- an ARIA landmark with the wrong role is worse than no landmark | Incorrect ARIA roles mislead screen reader users about page structure |
| SR-003 | Alternative text assessment MUST distinguish between decorative images (should have empty alt) and informative images (should have descriptive alt) | Applying alt text rules uniformly without distinguishing purpose creates either verbose screen reader output (alt text on decorative images) or missing information (empty alt on informative images) |
| SR-004 | Screen reader compatibility assessment is structural (semantic HTML, ARIA), not experiential -- this limitation MUST be disclosed per P-022 | The evaluator cannot simulate the actual screen reader experience across different AT combinations (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver with different browsers) |
| SR-005 | Every screen reader finding MUST reference the specific WCAG success criterion and cite evidence from the input artifacts | Findings without WCAG criterion references are not actionable for compliance remediation |

---

## Cognitive Load Assessment Protocol

Cognitive load assessment evaluates information density, reading level, consistency, and error prevention mechanisms.

> **Source:** W3C (2023). WCAG 2.2 Principle 3 (Understandable). Nielsen (1994b) severity scale for cognitive barrier assessment.

### Test Matrix

| Test | Evaluation Criteria | WCAG Criterion | Level |
|------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| Reading level | Content appropriate for target audience's reading level | 3.1.5 | AAA |
| Consistent navigation | Navigation mechanisms consistent across pages/screens | 3.2.3 | AA |
| Error prevention | Reversible submissions; confirmation for consequential actions | 3.3.4 (AA), 3.3.6 (AAA) | AA/AAA |
| Input assistance | Labels, instructions, and suggestions provided for user input | 3.3.2 (A), 3.3.3 (AA) | A/AA |
| Redundant entry | Information previously entered is auto-populated or selectable | 3.3.7 (A, new in 2.2) | A |
| Consistent help | Help mechanisms in consistent relative order across pages | 3.2.6 (A, new in 2.2) | A |

### Cognitive Load Rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| CG-001 | Reading level evaluation MUST use the Flesch-Kincaid readability formula when sufficient English text is available for analysis. When text is in a non-English language, use the appropriate language-specific readability formula (e.g., SMOG for Spanish, LIX for Scandinavian languages) or flag as "Language-specific readability assessment required" with MEDIUM confidence | Flesch-Kincaid provides a quantifiable, reproducible reading level assessment. Language-specific formula guidance prevents misapplication of English-calibrated formulas to non-English content |
| CG-002 | When text is insufficient for Flesch-Kincaid computation (e.g., only labels and short UI copy), use AI-assisted reading level assessment and flag as MEDIUM synthesis confidence | AI-assessed reading levels without a formal readability formula are judgment-based and must be disclosed |
| CG-003 | Consistent navigation evaluation MUST compare navigation patterns across at minimum 2 pages or screens when multi-page input is available | Single-page evaluation cannot assess navigation consistency; flag as "Single-page assessment -- cross-page consistency not evaluated" when only one page is provided |
| CG-004 | Error prevention evaluation MUST assess both reversibility of submissions and presence of confirmation dialogs for consequential actions | Missing either reversibility or confirmation assessment produces incomplete error prevention findings |
| CG-005 | Cognitive load assessment findings are classified as MEDIUM synthesis confidence when based on AI judgment about user cognitive burden | Presenting cognitive load assessments as objective measurements without confidence disclosure violates P-022 |

---

## Conformance Level Determination Rules

Conformance level is determined from the aggregate per-criterion results, not from individual findings.

> **Source:** W3C (2023). WCAG 2.2 [Understanding Conformance]. Conformance is assessed at the level (A, AA, AAA), not per criterion.

### Determination Rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| CD-001 | Conformance at Level A is achieved only when ALL Level A success criteria receive PASS or NOT APPLICABLE status | A single Level A FAIL prevents Level A conformance |
| CD-002 | Conformance at Level AA is achieved only when ALL Level A AND Level AA success criteria receive PASS or NOT APPLICABLE status | AA conformance requires complete A conformance plus all AA criteria passing |
| CD-003 | Conformance at Level AAA is achieved only when ALL success criteria at all three levels receive PASS or NOT APPLICABLE status | AAA conformance requires complete A + AA + AAA conformance |
| CD-004 | If the achieved conformance level is lower than the target level, the output MUST state: "Target: {target}. Achieved: {achieved}. {N} criteria at {target level} failed." | Ambiguous conformance reporting creates false legal compliance confidence |
| CD-005 | If no conformance level is achieved (one or more Level A criteria fail), the output MUST state: "Conformance level: None achieved. {N} Level A criteria failed." | Even when the target is higher, Level A failures must be highlighted as the most critical gap |

---

## Remediation Priority Rules

Remediation recommendations are prioritized based on severity, conformance level, and user impact.

### Priority Ranking Methodology

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| RP-001 | Remediation items MUST be ranked by: (1) severity descending (4 before 3 before 2), (2) conformance level ascending within severity (Level A before AA before AAA), (3) estimated user impact within same severity and level | Non-systematic priority ranking produces remediation lists that do not address the most critical barriers first |
| RP-002 | Every remediation recommendation MUST reference a specific WCAG technique by ID (e.g., "Technique ARIA14", "Technique G18", "Technique H67") | Technique references enable engineering teams to look up implementation guidance directly from W3C documentation |
| RP-003 | Remediation effort estimates MUST use one of three values: Low (< 1 day), Medium (1-3 days), High (> 3 days) | Standardized effort levels enable resource planning; finer-grained estimates suggest false precision |
| RP-004 | The impact field MUST describe who benefits from the fix, referencing the Persona Spectrum analysis when applicable | Connecting remediation to specific persona scenarios demonstrates the "solve for one, extend to many" principle |
| RP-005 | Remediation priority ranking is classified as MEDIUM synthesis confidence -- priority involves AI judgment about relative impact and effort | Presenting priority rankings as objective measurements violates P-022 |

### Remediation Output Format

| Priority | WCAG Criterion | Severity | Affected Element | Remediation | Effort Estimate | Impact |
|----------|---------------|----------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| {rank} | SC {X.Y.Z} | {0-4} | {element} | {fix with technique reference} | Low / Medium / High | {who benefits, persona reference} |

## Quality Gate Integration

How the inclusive design evaluation maps to the S-014 LLM-as-Judge quality dimensions for quality gate scoring (H-13, >= 0.92 for C2+ deliverables).

> **Source:** `.context/rules/quality-enforcement.md` [Quality Gate]. `skills/ux-inclusive-design/SKILL.md` [Synthesis Hypothesis Confidence].

### S-014 Dimension Mapping

| S-014 Dimension | Weight | Inclusive Design Mapping | Verification |
|----------------|--------|-------------------------|--------------|
| Completeness | 0.20 | All four POUR principles evaluated; all success criteria at target level assessed; all interaction patterns have Persona Spectrum profiles | Count of criteria evaluated vs. criteria in scope; count of interaction patterns with complete 4x3 matrices |
| Internal Consistency | 0.20 | Severity assignments consistent across similar findings; conformance determination consistent with per-criterion results; Persona Spectrum scenarios consistent with WCAG findings | No contradictory severity/status pairs (SD-001); conformance level matches aggregate criterion results (CD-001 through CD-005) |
| Methodological Rigor | 0.20 | WCAG evaluation follows POUR order; Persona Spectrum follows Microsoft methodology; severity scale aligns with Nielsen | Evidence of systematic step-by-step evaluation; methodology citations present |
| Evidence Quality | 0.15 | Every finding has specific evidence; every contrast ratio has hex/RGB values (or degraded mode flag); every keyboard finding has affected element and observed behavior | No findings without evidence; no contrast claims without computed ratios |
| Actionability | 0.15 | Every remediation references a WCAG technique; effort estimates are present; impact descriptions connect to persona scenarios | All FAIL findings have actionable remediation; no "fix this" without technique reference |
| Traceability | 0.10 | Every finding references a specific WCAG success criterion; every Persona Spectrum profile cross-references WCAG criteria; engagement ID and target level are documented | All criterion IDs present; all profile-to-criterion cross-references valid |

## Self-Review Checklist

Before persisting the evaluation report, verify all items below (S-010):

- [ ] 1. All four POUR principles have been evaluated with per-criterion pass/fail status (PR-001, PS-001)
- [ ] 2. The conformance level result is correctly determined -- all criteria at that level PASS (CD-001 through CD-005)
- [ ] 3. Every color contrast element has foreground/background values and computed ratios, or is flagged for manual measurement in degraded mode (CC-001, CC-003, CC-004)
- [ ] 4. Every keyboard navigation issue has the affected element, expected behavior, observed behavior, and WCAG criterion (KB-001)
- [ ] 5. Every screen reader finding has evidence and WCAG criterion reference (SR-005)
- [ ] 6. Every interaction pattern has a complete Persona Spectrum profile with all 12 cells populated (PS-012)
- [ ] 7. Every FAIL finding has a severity rating of 1-4; every PASS finding has severity 0 (SD-001, SD-002)
- [ ] 8. Every remediation recommendation references a WCAG technique (RP-002)
- [ ] 9. The Synthesis Judgments Summary lists each AI judgment call with confidence classification (SD-004, PS-014, CG-005, RP-005)
- [ ] 10. The navigation table is present and all anchors resolve (H-23)
- [ ] 11. Degraded mode disclosure is present if Figma MCP was unavailable (P-022)
- [ ] 12. Remediation priorities are ranked by severity descending, then conformance level ascending (RP-001)
- [ ] 13. Handoff data includes only findings with severity >= 2 (handoff threshold)
- [ ] 14. The executive summary states the achieved conformance level and critical violation count (CD-004, CD-005)
- [ ] 15. P-022 limitations disclosure requirements are met: single-evaluator disclosure present, residual limitations listed, and input mode limitations documented (LM-001)

## Limitations Disclosure Rules

P-022 (no deception about capabilities) requires explicit disclosure of evaluation limitations. These rules codify the minimum disclosure obligations for the evaluation report.

> **Source:** `docs/governance/TOM_CONSTITUTION.md` (P-022). `skills/ux-inclusive-design/templates/accessibility-report-template.md` [Limitations and Reliability].

| Rule ID | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---------|------|-------------------------|
| LM-001 | The evaluation report MUST include a Limitations and Reliability section containing: (a) a single-evaluator disclosure stating that full WCAG 2.2 compliance requires manual AT testing, automated tools, and user testing with people who have disabilities, (b) a residual limitations list (cannot replicate AT testing, persona profiles are heuristic models, severity is MEDIUM confidence), and (c) input mode limitations disclosure when operating in degraded mode | Omitting limitations disclosure presents AI-evaluated findings as comprehensive compliance certification, violating P-022 |
